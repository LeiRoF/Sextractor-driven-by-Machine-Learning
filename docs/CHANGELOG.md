# 2/11/2022

- Started to watch [object detection AI tutorial on youtubee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkISICHH-U)
  - **LIMITATION**: trade-off between speed and precision

# 3/11/2022
- Continued to watch [object detection AI tutorial on youtubee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkISICHH-U)
- Found [collection of models based on TensorFlow 2.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) with indication of accuracy, speed and output type.
  - Assuming that we are searching for accuracy, not speed
  - "**CenterNet HourGlass104 Keypoints 1024x1024**" model got the higher score on COCO 2017 dataset.

- Continued to watch [object detection AI tutorial on youtubee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkISICHH-U)
- **LIMITATION**: TensorFlow models use a specific resolution (usually squared) and automatically compress/decompress pictures that are not using this resolution. As we are dealing with small objects on very high resolution pictures, a compression can result to a loss of information and thus a loss of accuracy. We then have to chose or design a model with a large image resolution as input (which will implies long training phase)
  - **TL;DR** the accuracy of the detections will most probably propotional to $\frac a c$, where $a$ is the angular resolution and $c$ is the compression ratio.
- 3 types of output:
  - Boxes: 2 coordinates representing the box in which there is the object (the most popular one)
  - Keypoints: ~~1 coordinate~~ (corrected 05/11/2022) on the object -> We are more interested in this one
  - Masks: that  define the border of the iobject

# 5/11/2022
- Found [a place to select a model according to a specific problem](https://tfhub.dev/s?fine-tunable=yes&module-type=image-object-detection)
- Found [general object detection model application notebook](<https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/tf2_object_detection.ipynb#scrollTo=HtwrSqvakTNn>)
- **Erratum**: Kpoints are actually several coordinates points representing relevant parts of the object (i.e. smaller objects that composer the first one or highly caracteristic part of objects). For instance, for a human, it can be a head, hands, shoulders etc. In the case of stars,it can still be used with 1 keypoint at the center of the star, so it's not an issue.
- **Project consideration**: At this point I have the feeling that, compared to "basic" neural networks such as the one I made for [my previous project](https://github.com/LeiRoF/M1-TNO_Detection_Efficiency) (where the goal was to guess a fix number of values according to a fixed size input array) the object detection models are well more complexe. So complexe that none of the popular tutorial seems to explain how to design one by ourself. It seems to be something dedicated to researchers. If it's the case then the "tuning model" part of this project will have to be redefined into searching the best existing model for this application.

- According to some exemple found on the web, the data have to be in an xml form:

  ```xml
  <annotation>
      <folder>{folder}</folder>
      <filename>{filename}</filename>
      <path>{path}</path>
      <source>
          <database>Unknown</database>
      </source>
      <size>
          <width>{width}</width>
          <height>{height}</height>
          <depth>1</depth>
      </size>
      <object>
          <name>star</name>
              <pose>Unspecified</pose>
              <truncated>Unspecified</truncated>    
              <difficult>Unspecified</difficult>
              <bndbox>
                  <xmin>{x1}</xmin>
                  <ymin>{y1}</ymin>
                  <xmax>{x2}</xmax>
                  <ymax>{y2}</ymax>
              </bndbox>
      </object>
  </annotation>
  ```

- In a totally unscheduled way, I probably found the way to train a TensorFlow model. Fun fact: this solution was provided by another ChatGPT from OpenAI. So an AI provided me the informations I was searching for several dozen hours... I will try it tomorrow.

# 06/12/2022

- Edited the way to export data to try the solution given by ChatGPT (see 05/12/2022)
- Organized files in steps to be very user-friendly

# 31/12/2022

- Previous solution doesn't work because the models seems to not be trainable, but I found this tutorial: https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html, I will test it.

# 03/01/2023

- I gave up with the previous tutorial due to the mess to install dependencies and make it work while lot of stuff used are deprecated.
- I just thought about looking at PyTorch instead of TensorFlow, which looks more user-friendly.
- I found a new tutorial to train an object detection model (yoloV5): https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data, with a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb) associated to the model.
- I succeded to train the model! At least, according to the output, now I have to train it on a big fdataset and look test some predictions.
