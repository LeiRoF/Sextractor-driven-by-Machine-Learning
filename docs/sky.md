# ðŸŒŸ Sky

The sky module allow to create and edit a sky picture in ideal conditions (no atmosphere, no telescope, no camera, no noise, no diffraction etc.). Stars are the represented as purely gaussian sources.

Import: `from src import sky`

## Class sky.`Sky`

### Attributes

- **N**: An integer number of pixel width for the generated image (square image of N by N pixels).
- **nb_stars**: An integer number of stars to generate. If it is not defiend, the default value is `N//10`.
- **fwhm**: A float number representing the full width at half maximum of the stars (in pixels). If it is not defined, the default value is 10 pixels.
- **intensity_prob**: A function that takes a float number between 0 and 1 and returns a float number between 0 and 1. This function is used to define the intensity of the generated stars. The default value is a constant function that returns 1.
- **noise_intensity**: A float number representing the mean intensity of the noise. If it is not defined, there will be no noise.
- **noise_std**: A float number representing the standard deviation of the noise. If it is not defined, there will be no noise.
- **Picture**: A 2D numpy array representing the generated image (each pixel is a float number between 0 and 1, representing the light intensity).
